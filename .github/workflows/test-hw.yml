# To reduce the load (especiually on the machine queue) we cancel any older runs
# of this workflow for the current PR. Such runs exist, if there were new pushes
# to the PR's branch without waiting for the workflow to finish. As a side
# effect, pushing new commits now becomes a convenient way to cancel all the
# older runs, e.g. if they are stuck and would only be stopped by the timeout
# eventually.
# Note that we could do the concurrency handling at a finer level, and only wrap
# the actual run on the hardware. But there seems not much gain in letting the
# older builds run, as these are usually obsolete with new pushes also.
